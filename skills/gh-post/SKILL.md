  Authors and submits high-signal, anti-slop GitHub issues (bug reports, feature
  proposals) and pull requests by scanning repository conventions, maintainers,
  title prefixes, and templates, drafting into an artifact, and gating on user
  approval before submission. Use when triggered via /gh-post or when asked to
  file, draft, format, or submit a GitHub issue, bug report, feature request, or
  pull request. Don't use for triaging existing PR comments (use pr-triage),
  reviewing a PR diff (use pr-review), or Google3 Piper CLs (use cl-finalize).

# GitHub Post (`/gh-post`)

Guidelines, automated orientation tooling, and execution protocols for authoring
and submitting high-signal, anti-slop GitHub issues and pull requests without AI
formatting noise.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Orient with a local Git repository checkout's conventions:
kscripts gh-orient --dir /path/to/repo

# Orient with a remote GitHub repository (zero local clone required):
kscripts gh-orient -R invertase/melos
```

## Invocation Style & Slash Command

Trigger the skill via the `/gh-post` slash command or natural language
equivalents:

```markdown
/gh-post a PR with these changes
/gh-post a new issue requesting the feature we discussed
/gh-post a bug report for the crash when passing empty config
/gh-post draft a feature proposal for smart dependent versioning in invertase/melos
```

## The 5-Step Workflow

    C --> D["4. Mandatory Approval Gate<br><code>ask_question</code> (Hard Stop)"]
    D --> E["5. Execution & Verification<br><code>gh issue/pr create --body-file</code>"]
```

---

### Step 1: Intake & Disambiguation (STOP. DON'T GUESS.)

The agent MUST have crystal-clear clarity on two fundamental parameters before
doing any work:

1. **Target Post Type**: Is this an **Issue** (Bug Report, Feature Proposal) or
   a **Pull Request**?
2. **Target Repository**: Which exact GitHub repository (`owner/repo`)?

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **STOP. DON'T GUESS.** If the user's intent is ambiguous (e.g. _"create a post
> for this"_ without specifying Issue vs. PR), or if the target repository
> cannot be deterministically resolved from the current git checkout, or if
> multiple remotes/forks exist: **The agent MUST STOP and explicitly ask the
> user for clarification** using `ask_question` or chat before proceeding. Never
> guess or fabricate targets.

---

### Step 2: Repository Orientation

Before drafting, run `kscripts gh-orient` (or the bare `gh-orient` shim) to
inspect the target repository's maintainers, title prefixes, label vocabulary,
and native templates:

```bash
# For a local git repository checkout:
kscripts gh-orient --dir <path-to-repo>

# For a remote repository (zero local clone required):
kscripts gh-orient -R invertase/melos
```

- **What it gathers**:
  - Active human maintainers and reviewers (filtering out automated bots).
  - Common issue title prefixes (`request:`, `[analyzer]`, `area/foo:`).
  - Common PR title prefixes (`feat(scope):`, `fix(scope):`, `chore:`).
  - Repository label vocabulary and detected issue/PR form schemas (`.yml` field
    IDs).
- **Slop Contagion Guardrail**: Use orientation output _strictly_ for taxonomy,
  prefixes, and template adherence. Do NOT adopt decorative slop, emojis, or
  conversational fluff found in historical repository posts.

---

### Step 3: Draft into an ARTIFACT First

Always draft the complete title and body into a dedicated Markdown artifact in
the conversation artifact directory (`<appDataDir>/brain/<conversation-id>/`)
before touching the GitHub CLI, explicitly namespaced by repository:

- **For Issues**: `draft_github_<owner>_<repo>_issue.md` _(e.g.,
  `draft_github_invertase_melos_issue.md` or
  `draft_github_kevmoo_scripts_dart_issue.md`)_
- **For Pull Requests**: `draft_github_<owner>_<repo>_pr.md` _(e.g.,
  `draft_github_invertase_melos_pr.md` or
  `draft_github_kevmoo_scripts_dart_pr.md`)_

Always provide `ArtifactMetadata` with `RequestFeedback: true` so the user can
review the rendered draft directly in the UI.

#### Core Philosophy & Anti-Slop Rules (Negative Invariants)

Maintainers suffer from low-effort LLM fatigue. A good submission takes under 15
seconds to triage. Strictly enforce:

- **No Decorative Emojis**: Never prefix titles, headers, or bullet points with
  emojis (`🚀`, `🐛`, `📋`, `💡`, `✨`, `⚠️`, `🔍`).
- **No Gratuitous Dividers**: Do not insert `---` horizontal rules between every
  minor section. Standard Markdown headers (`###`) provide sufficient hierarchy.
- **No Conversational Fluff or Pleasantries**:
  - Omit opening pleasantries (_"While investigating the codebase..."_, _"I hope
    this helps..."_).
  - Omit closing pleasantries (_"Let me know what you think!"_, _"I would be
    happy to submit a PR..."_).
- **No Speculative Architecture Essays**:
  - In bug reports: State the observed defect, provide exact error logs/repro
    steps, and limit proposed fixes to 1–2 factual sentences (or omit entirely).
  - In PRs: Explain strictly the rationale ("why") and the isolated diff ("what
    changed").
- **No Inline Multiline Shell Escapes**: Never pass multiline Markdown inline
  via `--body "line 1\nline 2"`. Always use `--body-file`.

---

### Step 4: Mandatory Approval Gate (Hard Stop)

Before running `gh issue create` or `gh pr create`, the agent MUST halt
execution and prompt the user for explicit confirmation using `ask_question`.

```dart
// Example confirmation prompt
ask_question({
  questions: [
    {
      question: "I have prepared the draft in the artifact. Would you like to create the GitHub Issue now?",
      options: [
        "(Recommended) Yes, create issue via gh issue create",
        "No, keep as draft only"
      ]
    }
  ]
});
```

- **If Approved**: Proceed to Step 5.
- **If Declined / Paused**: Keep the artifact as draft and yield cleanly.

---

### Step 5: Execution & Verification

1. **Write Body to Temporary File**:
   ```bash
   # Extract the body content from the artifact to /tmp/post_body.md
   ```
2. **Execute Submission**:
   ```bash
   # For Issues:
   gh issue create -R owner/repo --title "[subsystem] Imperative Title" --body-file /tmp/post_body.md
   rm /tmp/post_body.md

   # For Pull Requests:
   gh pr create --title "feat(scope): imperative summary" --body-file /tmp/post_body.md
   rm /tmp/post_body.md
   ```
3. **Verify Output**: Confirm the submission succeeded and output the clickable
   link (`https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123` or
   `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`).

---

## Title Conventions & Disambiguation

Use concise, imperative titles (≤70 characters):

- **When Authoring an Issue**: Adopt the repository's issue prefix convention
  (e.g., `request: ...`, `[subsystem] ...`, `area/foo: ...`).
- **When Authoring a PR**: Adopt Conventional Commits (`feat(scope): ...`,
  `fix(scope): ...`, `refactor(scope): ...`) unless the repository explicitly
  mandates an alternative format.

| Post Type   | Format Pattern                      | High-Signal Example                                               | Slop Example to Avoid                            |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| **Bug**     | `[subsystem] Failure on condition`  | `[analyzer] Crash with NullPointer when config.json is empty`     | `Bug in analyzer` or `[CRITICAL] System failure` |
| **Bug**     | `subsystem: Failure on condition`   | `cli: Flag --output fails when target directory is missing`       | `CLI tool is broken`                             |
| **Feature** | `[subsystem] Imperative capability` | `[auth] Support PKCE flow in OAuth2 authentication client`        | `Feature request: make authentication better`    |
| **Feature** | `request: Imperative capability`    | `request: avoid cascading releases when constraints allow update` | `Feature idea for melos`                         |
| **PR**      | `type(scope): imperative summary`   | `feat(orient): add remote repo support and bot filter`            | `Updates and fixes`                              |

## Mapping Standard Sections to GitHub YAML Issue Forms

When a repository uses GitHub Issue Forms (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.yml`), the
issue body is rendered as sequential H3 markdown sections matching each form
element's `label:` attribute. Map conceptual anti-slop sections to the form's
specific fields:

| Conceptual Section     | Common YAML Field IDs               | Rendered Form Heading                                   |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Trigger Command**    | `command`, `repro_command`          | `### Command`                                           |
| **Context & Problem**  | `description`, `context`, `problem` | `### Description` or `### Context`                      |
| **Reasoning / Impact** | `reasoning`, `motivation`           | `### Reasoning`                                         |
| **Proposed Solution**  | `solution`, `proposal`, `idea`      | `### Proposed Solution`                                 |
| **Additional Context** | `additional_context`, `comments`    | `### Additional Context` (put Acceptance Criteria here) |
